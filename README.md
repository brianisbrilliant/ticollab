# ticollab
tic80 collaborative testing
# so
we have 1 folder, 5 files
*collab.lua - the main script tic80 calls when the collab.tic cart is ran
*collab.tic - that cart
*collaberate.lua - the cart exported as a lua file(pro feature) might help idk
*player.lua - a simple require example to show brian how it's done
*sprites.gif - exported sprites used in the cart

# now
i'm not sure of other OS's but on good ol linux dropping these files into the working directory for tic80 gives us access to 
all this. until a better option becomes available this works, but is messy as the working dir for tic80 becomes an unorganized pile of files.
anyway, get it running in tic
# your turn
go add and change things around! i'll pull the latest changes from github and make it run on my computer and we're collaberating!
